# ChatGPT Projects vs Custom GPTs
**Understand memory, collaboration, and when to use each**

---

## What are Projects?
Projects are **personal workspaces** in ChatGPT. Theyâ€™re designed to help you keep track of your work over time. Unlike a one-off chat, projects can **remember past conversations**, adapt to your style, and organize related work in one place.

**Key points:**
- Personal to your account
- Remember across sessions
- Adapt to your needs over time
- Memory can be set to *project-only*
- **Not shareable** â€” you can share chats, but not the whole project

ðŸ‘‰ Think of a project as your **personal notebook** inside ChatGPT.

## What are Custom GPTs?
Custom GPTs are like **mini-apps** you can build and share. They donâ€™t have memory, but they do follow the **rules, files, and APIs** you provide. This makes them great for consistency and repeatability.

**Key points:**
- No memory â€” behavior stays the same for everyone
- Defined by:
  - System instructions (rules, tone, persona)
  - Uploaded files, links, or FAQs
  - Connected APIs
- Shareable across your team or even publicly
- Best for standardized workflows

ðŸ‘‰ Think of a Custom GPT as a **printed manual**: reliable, clear, but not adaptive.

## Key Differences

| Feature | Projects | Custom GPTs |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| **Memory** | Yes, adapts over time | No, behavior is fixed |
| **Personalization** | Learns from your style and work | Same for all users |
| **Collaboration** | Not shareable (except chats) | Shareable with team or public |
| **Best for** | Personal workflows, evolving projects | Tools, training, standardized outputs |

---

## Common Use Cases
- **Use a Project whenâ€¦**
  - You want ChatGPT to remember your ongoing work
  - Youâ€™re experimenting and need a space that adapts
  - You want continuity across multiple sessions

- **Use a Custom GPT whenâ€¦**
  - You want to share a tool with teammates
  - You need everyone to use the same version
  - Youâ€™re publishing an assistant for external use

---

## Collaboration Options

**Option 1: Mirror Projects**
- Each teammate creates their own version of the project
- Share setup instructions and files
- Updates must be synced manually (v1.0, v1.1, etc.)
- Best for experimentation and learning together

**Option 2: Share a Custom GPT**
- Build one Custom GPT with your chosen files, instructions, or APIs
- Share it across your workspace
- Everyone automatically uses the latest version
- Best for consistency and team rollouts

## Getting Started

### Create a Project
1. From your ChatGPT dashboard, click **New Project**
2. Add files, notes, or context
3. Enable memory to keep continuity
4. Keep your work organized in one workspace

### Create a Custom GPT
1. From your dashboard, click **Explore GPTs > Create**
2. Add system instructions (rules, tone, persona)
3. Upload files or connect APIs
4. Set visibility (private, workspace, or public)
5. Share with your team or publish broadly

---

## Whatâ€™s Missing Today
Currently, projects are not designed for team sharing. Users have requested:
- Shared projects with memory across multiple users
- Role-based permissions (view/edit)
- Team memory that persists beyond individuals

---

## Quick Analogy
- **Project = Notebook** that grows with you
- **Custom GPT = Manual** everyone uses the same way

---

âœ… **Takeaway**
- Use a **Project** when you want evolving, personal memory
- Use a **Custom GPT** when you want a sharable, consistent tool
