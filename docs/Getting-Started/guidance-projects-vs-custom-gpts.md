# Guidance: Projects vs. Custom GPTs

City staff often ask whether to start with a **Project** or a **Custom GPT**.

- **Projects** are personal workspaces. Use them for experimenting on tasks like drafting permit
  letters or summarizing council agendas. Great for individual productivity.
- **Custom GPTs** are shareable assistants. Use them when multiple staff need the same workflow,
  such as a GPT for common zoning questions or HR policy lookups.

**Tip:** Start in a Project to prove value, then convert the workflow into a Custom GPT for team use.
