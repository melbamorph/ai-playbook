# Playbook: Working with a Project (Personal Workspace)

## Why this matters
Projects let staff explore AI privately before sharing workflows.

## Outcomes to target
- Draft routine documents faster (e.g., permit conditions).
- Capture learning safely before wider deployment.

## Checklist
- Define a small task to automate.
- Set privacy settings so only you can access the project.
- Log useful prompts and results for later reuse.

## Artifacts
- Prompt log
- Example outputs

## Anti-patterns
- Uploading sensitive resident data without approval.
- Treating a project as a finished solution for others.
