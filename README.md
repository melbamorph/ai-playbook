# Municipal AI Playbook

This repository houses guidance and playbooks that help city staff explore AI in day‑to‑day work.
The content is organized by community categories so finance, HR, leadership, communications and
other teams can quickly find material written for them.

## How to use
1. Browse the `docs/` folder or visit the GitHub Pages site to navigate by category.
2. Start with **Getting Started** if you’re new to AI in the workplace.
3. Each playbook follows a consistent format: why it matters, outcomes, checklist, artifacts,
   and anti‑patterns.

## Contribution notes
- Issues and suggestions: open an issue using the suggestion template.
- Pull requests: follow the PR template.
- Content should reflect OpenAI values—humanity first, humility, creativity over control,
  and rapid updates—and align with the AI Adoption Manager role by codifying best
  practices and FAQs for municipal audiences.
